![pure.md - Markdown delivery network for LLMs](https://pure.md/assets/og.png)

[pure.md](https://pure.md) lets your scripts, APIs, apps, agents, etc reliably access web content in markdown format -- simply prefix any URL with `pure.md/`.
It avoids bot detection and renders JavaScript for SPAs, and can convert HTML, PDFs, images, and more into pure markdown. Like a CDN for markdown content, it globally caches responses for future requests to the same resource, relieving stress on origin web servers.
